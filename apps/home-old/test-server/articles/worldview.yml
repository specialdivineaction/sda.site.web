  <p>A worldview is a set of assumptions in the form of a unifying picture or narrative that shapes
  the way in which each one of us understands what is going in our lives and in the world as a whole.
  A worldview provides a simplified account of the basic nature of the world or uni-verse, and may
  also provide an account of its origins, future and purpose. Consciously or un-consciously,
  worldviews shape our theoretical and practical reasoning, and it is almost impos-sible for anyone
  to lack a worldview entirely.</p>

  <p>Philosophers distinguish between the ideal and the empirical possession of a worldview. An ideal
  worldview, if fully spelled out, should be (1) consistent, (2) coherent, (3) inclusive, (4) justified,
  and (5) true.</p>

  <p>(1) A worldview is consistent if and only if there is no contradiction entailed by the various
  assumptions by which it is constituted. For instance, if it is part of one’s worldview that disembodied
  intelligence is impossible, then one must not hold at the same time that an-gels exist, since angels
  are disembodied intellectual beings.</p>

  <p>(2) A worldview is coherent if and only if the assumptions constituting it are mutually supportive.
  For instance, if it is part of one’s worldview that a morally perfect and loving God exists, then it
  is plausible to assume also that God is not indifferent to human moral choices.</p>

  <p>(3) A worldview is inclusive if and only if it can accommodate new insights, formerly unknown, in
  such a way that the consistency and coherence of the initial worldview is not destroyed. A worldview
  that is unable to accommodate such insights will have to change or be replaced.</p>

  <p>(4) A worldview is justified if and only if reasons can be given for accepting its as-sumptions.
  There is no unanimity amongst philosophers, however, concerning the kind of jus-tification that is
  legitimate for worldviews and which kind of reasons are good reasons. Amongst the models discussed
  are rational intuition, empirical verification, self-evidence, and revelation. Since worldviews can
  in principle differ in respect to their theory of justification, philosophical arguments to evaluate
  the adequacy of particular worldviews are limited and involve elements of circularity. The limitation
  due to the impossibility of a ‘view from no-where’, that is, a standpoint independent of all
  worldviews from which the validity of a justi-fication can be assessed in a neutral way. The circularity
  is due to the fact that any justificato-ry argument has assumptions of its own, hence limiting the scope
  for dialogue to those who share these assumptions.</p>

  <p>(5) The truth of a worldview is an aspiration but its meaning is hard to clarify, since there are
  different interpretations of truth and a particular definition of truth is itself part of a worldview.
  If the truth of an assumption is nothing over and above its consistency and coher-ence with other
  assumptions, then different worldviews can be referred to as true. If truth consists, however, in a
  correspondence of understanding with the way things really are, then only one worldview purporting to
  capture some aspect of reality can be entirely true (they can all be false, though). Since, however,
  worldviews are based on assumptions that are them-selves challenging to justify, it is unclear how we
  could decide which of these worldviews is the true one, or whether truth is even an adequate criterion.
  Some philosophers argue that only the pragmatic success of a worldview is relevant.</p>

  <p>Even if the above matters had been sufficiently clarified by way of philosophical re-flection, our
  possession of worldviews actually falls short of this ideal. The reason is that we are not ‘ideal
  rational believers’, fully aware of all the assumptions that are part of our worldview as well as of
  their relations and their justification. A more plausible way of under-standing how we possesses
  worldviews is to think of them as ‘horizons’, within which we live and move and have our being: in
  the everyday life, we interpret unconsciously the phenomena surrounding us according to our worldview,
  and we are forced to make the worldview explicit only in cases where some conflict arises with its assumptions.</p>

  <p>Worldviews today form a wide spectrum with regard to both natural and supernatural matters, and it
  is unlikely that humanity will converge on one particular understanding. Great-er awareness of one’s
  own worldview, however, and of the alternatives held by others togeth-er with a certain epistemic
  humility can be the beginning of dialogue and fruitful insight.</p>
body: >-

<p>The analysis of the logic, structure and essence of worldviews is of the utmost importance for any kind
of scientific, philosophical, or theological discussion. Much if not all of human en-quiry in the sciences
and in the humanities is nothing over and above participation in a process of worldview construction,
evaluation and refinement.</p>

<p>It is in and through worldviews that we understand the phenomena that are present to us, both individually
and collectively: first, our individual and social life is influenced by our worldview. It shapes the way in
which we understand phenomena and behave towards na-ture, one another, and ourselves. Second, on a global scale,
the history of humankind can be addressed as a history of worldview generation, change, collapse, and conflict.
There is liter-ally no realm of human life that is independent from one’s worldview. As Naugle (2002: 345)
rhetorically askes, “after all, what could be more important or influential than the way an indi-vidual, a
family, a community, a nation, or an entire culture conceptualizes reality? Is there anything more profound
or powerful than the shape and content of human consciousness and its primary interpretation of the nature of
things? When it comes to the deepest questions about human life and existence, does anything surpass the final
implications of the answers supplied by one’s essential Weltanschauung?”</p>

<p>Although worldviews are an essential part of the human cognitive situation, there is of-ten little awareness
of the logic, structure and essence of worldviews, not to mention the deep philosophical problems related to
questions concerning the adequacy, or even truth, of a par-ticular worldview in respect to the phenomena themselves.</p>

<p>In what follows I first clarify some of the necessary and sufficient conditions that are part of the specification
of the term “worldview” as it is used in contemporary philosophy.  In a second step I argue that factually none of us
is fully aware of his or her worldview, its en-tailments, or its alleged justification. The actual possession of a
worldview is rather like a hori-zon that defines the boundaries of the world in which we live and move and have our
being, often fading out of explicit awareness like the canvas of a picture. It is in need of evaluation only if there
is an obvious mismatch between the worldview and the phenomena themselves. Once this is clarified I turn to a discussion
of some of the most pressing philosophical prob-lems that surround questions concerning the comparison of worldviews in
respect to their ad-equacy to the phenomena, and in respect to their alleged truth or falsity. I argue that there is no
compelling philosophical argument to decide, once and for all, in favour of a particular worldview, although some
worldviews may be more or less ‘fitting’ or appropriate. The most we can achieve is a reflective awareness of our own
current worldview, its methodology, pre-suppositions, the reasons speaking in its favour, and its limits. I end by way
of providing a brief analysis of the importance of special divine action within Christian worldviews.</p>

<h1>A Brief Analysis of the Concept of a Worldview</h1>
<p>Let us start with the following agreement: a worldview is a set of assumptions that shapes the way in which each
one of us understands what is going in their life and in the world as a whole. A worldview captures theory and
practice both by way of providing an interpretational story of the origin, fundamental nature, future, and purpose
of the universe and by way of implying what has to be done from an ethical point of view in order to foster the
purpose of the universe. As Kim et al. (2012: 205) argue, “our worldview forms the context within which we base
our understanding of reality, knowledge, morality, and life’s meaning and purpose. Our worldview has a profound
impact on how we decide what is real versus unreal, what is right versus wrong, and what is important versus
unimportant. It shapes our culture and ex-presses itself in all institutions including the arts, religion,
education, media, and business.”</p>

<p>A worldview, though, is not just any set of assumptions that shapes the way we under-stand our life and the
world surrounding us. There are certain criteria that any set of assump-tions has to satisfy in order to qualify
as a worldview.</p>

<h2>Torldviews as Hierarchically Ordered Sets of Assumptions</h2>
<p>Worldviews are not loose conglomerations of assumptions mixed together. There has to be a clearly identifiable
hierarchy and order amongst the assumptions in respect to their importance and degree of fundamentality for the
respective worldview. Ideally, this hierarchy of assump-tions is grounded in some primitive axioms and presuppositions
that are not in need of further justification relative to the worldview in question. These axioms are said to be
self-evident, or transcendentally or pragmatically necessary.  Without such primitive presuppositions, no worldview
ould function as such.</p>

<p>Since worldviews are both abstract and psychologically relevant entities – worldviews are both sets of
propositions and objects of belief of rational beings – there are at least two ways according to which we can
measure the degree of importance of a particular assumption:</p>

<p>First, we can measure the importance of an assumption by way of spelling out the logi-cal relations amongst the
assumptions that are part of a worldview: an assumption is more im-portant the more that other assumptions logically
depend on it; that is, an assumption p is the more important for a worldview the more propositions q, r,…z, are
sufficient for its truth.</p>

<p>Second, according to the psychological criterion, the importance of an assumption can be measured by way of
the reluctance of people holding that worldview to give it up. Ideally both criteria coincide. For instance,
according to both criteria the assumption that God exists is more fundamental to Christian worldviews than the
assumption that an immaterial soul ex-ists. The difference is not in the sense of ‘degrees of truth’ but in the
fact that more proposi-tions entail the existence of God than the existence of an immaterial soul.</p>

<h2>Torldviews and the Mapping of Reality</h2>
<p>The purpose of a worldview is to map both factual and normative features of reality. The suc-cess of our
attempts to map reality depends on the potentials and limits of human cognition that are discovered through logical
and transcendental analysis. Although worldviews differ in respect to their interpretation of what precisely the
term “reality” denotes, it is plausible to assume that “reality” at least refers to the realm of phenomena that
constitutes one’s living-world, i.e. “the framework in terms of which man came to be aware of himself as
man-in-the-world” (Scharp et al. 2007: 374).</p>

<p>In order to map reality successfully, a worldview entails different types of proposi-tions. Such propositions,
which are declarative, normative, logical, and transcendental, corre-spond to the different aspects of reality that
the worldview intends to map.</p>

<p>First, a worldview entails declarative propositions because only declarative proposi-tions assert something about
what the world is like. Without such propositions no worldview is possible because nothing would be represented
propositionally to the mind. Declarative propositions provide answers to the question “What is there?” Such
propositions are, for in-stance, dealt with in ontology where the fundamental nature of reality is investigated.
They are also dealt with in particular areas of human scientific research. Although science is always related to,
and depends on philosophical reflection concerning its scope and limits, the scienc-es extend knowledge of
particulars that are beyond the reach of unaided philosophical reflec-tion, and in the light of which philosophical
presuppositions may need to be revised. Physics, for instance, deals especially with the quantitative behaviour of
the fundamental constituents of material reality, whereas biology investigates living organisms, their constitution
and devel-opment.</p>

<p>Second, a worldview also entails normative propositions that express what kinds of behaviour are morally right or
wrong, according to the worldview in question. Without norma-tive propositions, no worldview could specify the first
principles of how we should act. Nor-mative propositions provide answers to the question “What is goodness and right
action with-in this worldview?” Within the scope of these answers, the details are dealt with, for example, in
ethics, moral theology, the social sciences, and in law studies. Ethics draws out the implica-tions of these
fundamental norms applied especially to human flourishing in general, moral theology to the case of a purported
transformation of human nature through grace, and social sciences and law studies deal with questions concerning
the laws of behaviour that are valid in particular societies.</p>

<p>Finally, a worldview has to entail transcendental and logical assumptions. They consti-tute the meta-theory of
the worldview in question and thus specify its methodology, its stance on logically valid inference, and its
assumptions concerning the potentials and limits of human cognition. Because these assumptions are often primitive
axioms of a worldview and because they can vary between different worldviews that, as a consequence, propose
fundamentally different interpretations concerning the nature of reality, it is important to keep in mind that
the meta-theory of a worldview is part of that same worldview and not something that we can access independently
of our own worldview.</p>

<p>Although a worldview has to entail transcendental and logical assumptions, there are worldviews according to
which the categories of normative and descriptive propositions are empty. For instance, nihilistic worldviews
suppose that there are no objectively binding nor-mative propositions specifying the way we should behave, whereas
sceptical worldviews claim limitations to our knowledge concerning the fundamental structure of reality at all.</p>

<h2>Ttories, Narratives, and Images</h2>
<p>A worldview is not merely an abstract set of propositions capturing descriptive and normative features of reality
in a technical vocabulary. A worldview has to be psychologically accessible in ways that all those who share it are
able to understand and thus able to relate to their indi-vidual life. A worldview that only a few specialists are
able to understand after years of stud-ying would hardly be successful in terms of its potential to direct and guide
one’s life.</p>

<p>From a psychological and sociological point of view, metaphors, narratives (like fairy tales, novels and
parables), pictures, movies, opera, music, and the arts in general can be seen as ways to express the fundamental
assumptions of a particular worldview, and moreover in ways that do not presuppose a specialist level of knowledge.
Such means of expression often provide enough memorable content of a worldview to direct one’s life. In practice,
although these expressions may seem extrinsic to their content, every popular worldview in fact tends to be
associated with memorable and accessible metaphors, narratives, and pictures.</p>

<h2>Tormative Criteria of Rationality</h2>
<p>In addition to the features mentioned, the set of different types of hierarchically ordered as-sumptions
constitutive of a worldview has to satisfy certain normative conditions of rationali-ty that become explicit in
and through philosophical reflections on the worldview’s meta-theoretical demands on reason and rationality. Amongst
the most popular criteria are (1) con-sistency, (2) coherence, (3) inclusiveness, (4) warrant, and (5) truth.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Consistency: two (or more) arbitrary assumptions are consistent if and only if their conjunction does
        not entail a contradiction. Consequently, a worldview is consistent if and only if it does not entail
        assumptions the conjunction of which entails a contradiction. For instance, if A is the assumption that
        angels exist, B the assumption that angels are disembod-ied intelligent entities, and C the assumption
        that no disembodied, intelligent entities exist, then A, B, and C must not be part of one and the same
        worldview since in this case we obtain the contradiction that angels do and do not exist. Each pair of
        them, though, can be part of one and same worldview.</p></li>
	  <li><p>It is difficult to specify the term “coherence” precisely. I assume that two assump-tions are coherent
        if and only if there is mutual semantic or logical support between the as-sumptions in questions. Propositions
        are mutually related if there are close logical relations of entailment, and propositions are semantically
        related if they share some of their key terms. The condition of coherence, then, demands that the assumptions
        constitutive of a worldview gen-erate an organic system in which every assumption is interwoven with every
        other assumption on a logical and semantic level. For instance, if A is the assumption that God created the
        uni-verse, and B the assumption that the universe started with a Big Bang, then A and B cohere with the
        assumption that God created the universe by way of causing the Big Bang to occur.</p></li>
	  <li><p>In addition to being consistent and coherent sets of assumptions, worldviews should be inclusive.
        Inclusiveness is a worldview’s ability to deal with new phenomena: if some event occurs that previously
        was unheard of, then the worldview should be able to ac-count for the phenomenon in its own terms. If the
        worldview is not able to account for the new phenomenon in question, then it has to be extended in a way
        that respects the conditions of consistency and coherence. If successful, the worldview adapts to the new
        situation. If, however, the worldview is not able to account for the new phenomenon on the terms specified,
        then it will collapse in the light of the new phenomenon (cf. Quine 1951 and Kuhn 1996). For instance, the
        Newtonian worldview was unable to deal with quantum phenomena and therefore collapsed as the paradigmatic
        physical worldview (cf. Polkinghorne 2002), alt-hough still used as an approximation in limited cases. A
        worldview is all-inclusive if it is able to account for every phenomenon.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Truth and warrant constitute two overlapping and highly contested features related to the concept of a
        worldview. Warrant concerns the justification of a particular assumption that is part of a worldview, the
        standard for justification taken to be its adequacy in showing the truth of the assumption. Even assuming
        that we have a clear conception of what it means for an assumption to be true, the problem is that
        it is not clear what kind of warrant is suffi-cient and necessary for us to adopt a particular assumption
        as part of our worldview.</p>
        <p>The following views are often met in the discussion: an assumption is justified if (a) it is empirically
        verified, (b) it is rationally justified, (c) it is self-evident, (d) it is revealed, and (e) it is properly
        basic.</p>

	  <li><p>Although it seems to be a natural assumption that human beings engage in research of all kinds in order
        to obtain knowledge, and although knowledge is often said to entail truth, it is sometimes disputed that
        truth is a cognitive value as such for evaluating a worldview. What really matters, it is said, is
        whether the worldview enables us to get around in the world from a pragmatic point of view. Moreover, even
        if the best way to get around in the world is a worldview based on true propositions, there would still be
        different theories of truth that the worldview might deploy: if the truth of an assumption is nothing more
        than its coherence or consistency with other assumptions of a certain set of assumptions, then more then
        one worldview can be true. If truth consists in the correspondence between an assump-tion and the reality
        is depicts, then at most one worldview can be true – although they can all be false.</p></li>
  </ol>
<h2>That is a Worldview?</h2>
<p>A worldview is a consistent, coherent, inclusive, warranted, and true set of declarative, nor-mative and
logico-transcendental propositions that are hierarchically structured according to their degree of importance for
the worldview in question. Each worldview has to accept cer-tain assumptions as primitive presuppositions, and each
worldview has to be explicit about its meta-theory, that is, its methodology and its stance on the potentials and
limits of human cog-nition. A worldview should be expressible in readily accessible narratives, stories, and
images.</p>

<h1>Worldviews as the Interpretative Horizons of our Lives</h1>`
<p>Life without a worldview is practically impossible for human beings. Whether we like it or not, each one of us
has a worldview that explicitly or implicitly shapes the way in which we understand and perceive what is going on
in the world. As Vidal (2012: 312) says, “most people adopt and follow a worldview without much thinking. Their
worldview remains im-plicit. They intuitively have a representation of the world […], know what is good and what
is bad […], and have experience about how to act in the world […]. And this is enough to get by. Every one of us
is in need of a worldview, whether it is implicit or explicit.”</p>`

<p>The condition of being fully aware of one’s worldview presupposes that human beings are ideal rational believers.
An ideal rational believer is fully aware of his or her knowledge and of the justification of what he or she knows.
In more detail: an ideal rational believer that knows that p is the case at the same time (a) knows the reasons for
holding that p and (b) knows that q is the case if p entails q. An ideal rational believer is aware of his or her
complete body of knowledge all at once.</p>`

<p>Factually, none of us is an ideal rational believer: we are hardly aware of what we know, of what is implied by
our knowledge, or of the reasons why what we know is justified according to the worldview we hold. It is likely that
if we were to spell out our factual worldview we would discover many contradictions and assumptions for which we
cannot offer justification.</p>`

<p>This observation is hardly surprising: on the one hand, we are cognitively limited be-ings with finite time and
capacities to reflect explicitly on our worldview – we have a life to live; on the other, the body of knowledge of
humankind has reached a stage that hardly any-one is able to oversee. Like a tree, human knowledge has branched out
in an unmanageable number of ways and nowadays constitutes realms of increasing specialisation that only a few
people are able actually to understand. Although, for instance, quantum mechanics is all the rage today, it is
highly unlikely that many people are able to understand the problems, the equations and the metaphysical impact of
quantum mechanics.</p>`

<p>This situation, though, does not constitute a systematic problem. The toleration of a certain amount of ambiguity
in a worldview can be desirable, as a premature demand for cer-tainty can block off the acceptance of a revised
worldview that can accommodate apparent contradictions. Worldviews also operate with the idea of warranted social
knowledge. The idea of social knowledge is based on the assumption that members of one and the same worldview can
legitimately agree to participate in what can be referred to as “worldview-clouding”: there are available
specialists in any field of human enquiry who are able to provide the justification of all assumptions constitutive
of the worldview in question. Together the members of a worldview constitute the socially shared body of knowledge.
In Western cul-tures, this shared body of knowledge is in principle available to anyone interested in institu-tions
like libraries, universities, schools, museums, and the like.</p>

<p>Since from the point of view of the individual no complete and full worldview is fac-tually available, one may
usefully define the ‘empirical possession’ of a worldview as the prac-tical horizon in which one lives and moves and
has one’s being. For the individual, his or her worldview is the interpretative schema that most of the time
predetermines his or her interpre-tation of the phenomena surrounding him or her in a manner that functions on an
implicit and unconscious level. It is only in cases where some of the normative demands on a rational worldview are
violated that the individual is in actual need to make explicit the worldview and reflect upon it.</p>

<h1>The Many Problems of the Philosophy of Worldviews</h1>
<p>From a philosophical point of view, there are many problems related to the specification of the concept of a
worldview, the adequacy of a particular worldview, and the possibility to com-pare different worldviews in respect to their adequacy to the phenomena. Although it is often assumed that “philosophy can help someone form a rationally justified, true worldview, that is, an ordered set of propositions that one believes, especially propositions about life’s most important questions” (Mooreland et al. 2003: 13), it turns out that the situation is not as straightforward as one might wish.</p>

<h2>Tsychological and Cultural Problems of Worldview-Possession</h2>
<p>First, there are some psychological and cultural peculiarities related to the factual holding of a worldview.
According to the cultural problem, the possession of a worldview involves ele-ments of contingency. It seems to be
a matter of mere contingency which worldview we pos-sess because it depends on the place and time where we are born
and on the way in which we are educated. Most people grow up in a particular environment and absorb their preeminent
cultural, philosophical or religious assumptions from their family and social surroundings. Sec-ond, there are
psychological problems of self-deception: people are able to deceive themselves in order to escape the pressure to
change their worldview in the light of new phenomena, es-pecially if a worldview is closely linked to a sense of
one’s psychological identity.</p>

<p>Without minimising these challenges, they can still be addressed from a philosophical point of view. First, even
if the first adaption of a worldview is contingent upon our place and time of birth, it does not follow that we
cannot change our worldview on the basis of philo-sophical and scientific reflection and argument. There are, for
instance, cases where atheists become theists as a consequence of a proper reflection on the arguments that speak
in favour of a theistic worldview, and conversely some theists become atheists for various reasons, such as the
apparent inexplicability of suffering in the world. Although it is undeniable that the first worldview we adopt is
influenced by the time and place where we grew up, human be-ings are free to change their worldview in the course
of their life.</p>

<p>As it were, this freedom of human beings also explains their freedom not to change their worldview in face of
some problems confronting it. This explanation is rooted in the fact that a worldview is a representation of reality
to the human mind. The fact that a representa-tion is partial, ambiguous, and may even be contradicted on some
points does not force any-one to relinquish it. Indeed, it can be epistemically virtuous to hold back from an
over-eager readiness to relinquish a worldview, even in the face of contradiction, since the problems con-fronting
the worldview may themselves dissolve upon closer inspection. Moreover, even when the problems remain, some may
choose to hold onto the worldview at the price of limiting engagement in philosophy and the sciences. For example,
it is possible to find philosophers of science who are content to work with an essentially nineteenth century view
of physical reali-ty for the sake of some philosophical coherence, even at the price of limiting their dialogue
with experts in more contemporary physics.</p>

<h2>Troblems of Worldview-Comparison</h2>
<p>In addition to the problems mentioned, there is a fundamental philosophical turbulence as regards worldview
comparison that is extremely difficult to unknot: the very logic of the con-cept of a worldview blurs the distinction between philosophical and scientific arguments in favour of a particular worldview and the meta-theoretical presuppositions that are used in or-der to specify the normative demands put on sound argumentative discourse. Since worldviews entail both their theory of the world, and their own meta-theory that specifies the demands of rationality and reason that are to be met in order to formulate the theory in ques-tion, it is extremely difficult, if not outright impossible, to compare worldviews in respect to their adequacy to the phenomena, let alone in regard to the question whether they are true.</p>
<p>The problem consists in the fact that human beings are bound to a perspectival inter-pretation of the world even
in their attempts to specify the concept of a worldview. To be precise, the very specifications of the logic,
structure and essence of worldviews are them-selves presented against the background of a particular worldview and its meta-theory – ac-cording to which, for instance, consistency, coherence, warrant and truth belong to the core features of any worldview.</p>
<p>When it comes to the question of comparing the adequacy of different worldviews in respect to their account of
the phenomena we obtain the following conclusion: if, on the one hand, we suppose that our worldview and its
meta-theory set the definite standard for the adequacy of any worldview whatsoever, then we have to reject any worldview as adequate that does not satisfy these conditions. The risk here is one of philosophical imperialism, and nowadays the socio-political consequences of this kind of imperialism are eminent. If, on the other hand, we suppose that there are different meta-theories to evaluate the adequacy of a worldview, then we have to accept that there might be worldviews that do not of necessity share our criteria for worldview adequacy. Either way, there are classes of worldviews that are commensurable and classes of worldviews that are incommensurable. They are commensurable insofar as they share the same meta-theoretical demands on what a worldview is supposed to be, and they are incommensurable if they do not even agree on what we can expect a worldview to achieve.</p>

<h2>Truth and Worldviews</h2>
<p>Based on the arguments above it seems that the philosophical quest for truth and the question concerning which
worldview we should adapt cannot be answered in a way that is sufficient for every human being to accept: we can
only argue about the adequacy of a worldview with those with whom we share enough of the same assumptions as regards
reason and rationality. That is, we can disagree and argue only with those people who share enough of our
assumptions in order for a constructive dialogue to be possible. As a consequence, there is no philo-sophically
compelling way ultimately to decide between different worldviews once and for all. As Vidal (2012: 306-307) states
the matter: “The result is that human being use philosoph-ical, scientific, or religious insights – or a
combination of them – to handle this question for understanding, leading to very different kinds of worldviews.”</p>

<p>In order to show the adequacy and plausibility of a particular worldview, the best we may hope to do is to be
clear, explicit, and reflective about our theoretical and meta-theoretical assumptions and to show that according
to them a meaningful worldview is possi-ble, both theoretically and practically. As Vidal (2012: 318) says, “from a
dialectical and sec-ond-order perspective, a philosopher can explore and understand a plurality of worldviews. But
as she elaborates her first-order philosophical position, the same philosopher will still con-sider some worldviews
to be better objectively, subjectively, or socially than others.” Alt-hough this conclusion may seem unacceptably
modest to those who crave premature certaini-ty, experience suggests that such epistemic humility at least disposes
us to those insights that do, on the whole, lead to worldviews that are ultimately richer and more interesting.</p>

<h1>Christian Worldviews and Special Divine Action</h1>
<p>First of all, there is no such thing as the Christian worldview; there are simply too many dif-ferent
denominations that refer to themselves as ‘Christian’ while at the same time the corre-sponding worldviews entail
assumptions that are in conflict with presuppositions that are part of other Christian worldviews. For instance,

according to some protestant Christian worldviews, there is no genuine human freedom because God’s foreknowledge
has already fixed what is going to happen in this world and, consequently, who will be saved from a sote-riological
point of view. For other worldviews, though, there is genuine human freedom to accept or deny God’s offer of
salvation and hence to play a part in our own fate. Furthermore, according to some Christian worldviews, such as
the Roman Catholic one, reason itself is a valuable way to support the overall Christian case, whereas some
Christian denominations suppose that reason is too damaged to be reliable in matters of religious truth and that
the only way to deal with God is by faith alone (sola fides).</p>

<p>Although the different Christian denominations vary in the precise formulation of their overall worldview, two
things are clear. First, each Christian denomination attempts to pro-vide some kind of worldview insofar as each
one attempts to provide “a complete understand-ing for the subject’s known world and [tries] to introduce ways
of living that encompass every aspect of life, including one’s religious and ethical perspective as well as
social associations” (Carvalho 2006: 114). Second, although they differ as fully spelled out worldviews, there
are certain fundamental assumptions without which no Christian worldview could be classified as Christian and which
consequently all Christian denominations share with one another (cf. Göcke 2015a). Third, Christian worldviews,
although diverse, do cluster in groups around a few key principles.</p>

<p>The possibility of special divine action is one of these principles: no worldview that excludes the very
possibility of a God acting in history is adequate to the core of Christian teaching (cf. Göcke 2015b). As Cobb
(1973: 207) says: “The idea that God is active in a way that affects the course of human affairs is too basic to
the Biblical-Christian tradition to be set aside […] A God who in no sense acts in or on history would be a very
different God from that of Western religion and philosophy. God must be some kind of cause of events or else
there is no point in speaking of him at all.”</p>

      A different way to argue for the impossibility of miracles would be to posit the 'principle of causal closure', which Kim (1998, p. 40) formulates as follows: 'If you pick any physical event and trace out its causal ancestry or posterity, that will never take you outside the physical domain. That is, no causal chain will ever cross the boundary between the physical and the nonphysical.' In Wachter 2006 I object to this principle that it is not a result of physics (cf. Plantinga 2011, p. 89) and that it can be defended only by providing evidence against the existence of immaterial objects, and a modal version of the principle cannot be defended at all. See also Lowe 2000.
