                                        <div class="acc-segment">
                                            <p>The Ian Ramsey Centre for Science and Religion (IRC) at Oxford is pleased to offer three course awards, funded by a grant of the John Templeton Foundation, of <strong>US$5,000</strong> for the individual faculty member and <strong>US$10,000</strong> for the host institution to develop and implement courses or course modules on topics related to special divine action (SDA) at higher education institutions.</p>
                                            <p>Is there special divine action (SDA) in the world, beyond the purported effects of a divine first cause? Beliefs about particular kinds of special divine action (such as incarnation, inspirations, grace, miracles, providence, and resurrection) have had an incalculable impact on civilisation, being some of the most important inspirations for art, ethics, music, literature, philosophy, social institutions, theology, the perception of nature, and what human beings can and should hope for. If there is SDA, however, what is such action like and how would we know? Are there particular ways of thinking about the world that make such actions probable, possible or impossible? How does contemporary research in philosophy, theology, and science bear on these questions? What tools of scholarship can and should be used? From the point of view of knowledge and human flourishing, or from a divine perspective, are there advantages and disadvantages for human persons to take a stance for or against the possibility of some or all modes of SDA?</p>
                                            <p>The aim of this award is to stimulate informed engagement with such matters, especially at the graduate level. The program will provide three awards to faculty members who would like to develop and teach a course of one of the following two types:</p>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li><strong>Required course revisions</strong> — a required graduate course that does not currently contain a section on SDA issues, and which the applicant would like to revise to include such issues. These courses could be on any subject, including, without being limited to, philosophy of science, theology and religion, history of philosophy, etc.</li>
                                                <li><strong>New courses in SDA</strong> — a course dedicated to special divine action, under this name or any other significant denomination. To qualify, such courses must, if selected, be taught for credit within major degree programs at the institution and be a full semester, trimester, or quarter in duration. In addition, applicants must provide evidence from the overseeing administrator ensuring that the course can be taught at least twice during the four-year span after the award is made.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>Grants will be awarded by competitive evaluation on the basis of proposed syllabi. Proposals will need to be received by the IRC no later than <strong>February 15, 2015</strong>.</p>

                                            <p>Any institution of higher education around the world can apply and receive one of the three course development awards.</p>
                                            <p>This program is intended principally to stimulate the development and implementation of courses or course modules at university faculties, but applications are also welcome from other higher education institutions, teacher training colleges and religious educational institutions such as seminaries.</p>
                                            <p>The specific disciplines for these courses (or course revisions) can be wide-ranging, including for example, without being limited to, one (or a combination) of: biology, cosmology, epistemology, mathematics, neuroscience, philosophy, physics, psychology, religious studies, sociology, and theology.</p>

                                            <p>There are various ways in which courses might seek to engage with issues pertaining to SDA. For example, one might devote a course or course unit to exploring or interacting with key issues under the headings of:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Definitions of special divine action (SDA)</li>
                                                <li>Epistemological issues in relation to SDA</li>
                                                <li>Varieties of purported SDA in respect to object, end and circumstances</li>
                                                <li>Differences of purported SDA across various worldviews (scientific, philosophical, cultural, religious) and regions</li>

                                            </ul>
                                            <p>We also recommend reviewing the sample questions from the associated <a href="">cluster group award</a> as examples of the kinds of topic being addressed by the project, although both sources and questions are strictly illustrative, not exhaustive.</p>
                                            <p>Applicants are encouraged to be creative in their proposals for addressing their chosen topics, but applications that propose to bring together key insights from diverse disciplines will be looked on favourably. Favourable consideration will also be given to clear, focused topics. If you have any doubt about whether an idea for a new or modified course would be suitable, please contact the IRC at <a href="">ignacio.silva@theology.ox.ac.uk</a>.</p>
