                                        <p>The Special Divine Action project is developing a large, well-organised collection of digitised primary source material reflecting many strands of the conversation through the ages on the subject of SDA from theological, philosophical and historical perspectives. These historical resources will be combined with thematic introductions, critical commentaries and other resources to form a cohesive research collection to assist formal and self-directed scholarship and study. All material will be made available via the web and will be incorporated into pedagogical resources developed over the course of the project.</p>
                                        <p>Besides the compilation of primary sources, a special innovation of the project will be interactive visual tools to explore the content and relationships of these materials. With the exception of a small number of famous texts, many key works on SDA since the rise of modern science are little read today. The situation can be compared to a submerged landscape of ideas and connections, with just a few small rocks visible out of the water, rocks that attract most scholarly attention. To identify the overlooked works, read them and understand the interplay of ideas of this submerged landscape would normally take years of precious time and as a consequence is rarely attempted. The SDA project will this process of assimilation far easier by making the hidden works readily available and mapping their interconnections. Whatever text is taken as the starting point for entry, data visualization tools will enable readers to see and explore influences and provocations to and from other works, as well as consonances, convergences and pattern matches.</p> 
                                        <p>The ultimate aim is not only to improve the range and quality of sources that contribute to historical scholarship, but also to bring the wisdom of the past into dialogue with issues today connected to SDA, in the light of contemporary work in science, philosophy and theology.</p>
