Questions about divine action are scarcely new and have been studied extensively since the rise of early modern science, but much of what has been written is surprisingly little read today. Debates, scholarship and teaching in universities and schools are dominated by a tiny handful of texts, like a few scattered rocks emerging from the sea. The deeper landscape of ideas remains largely submerged from view, often because of pressures on time and a lack of practical access.

This project provides access by recovering the forgotten texts and landscapes of ideas so that more of the finest scholarship on divine action is made accessible to contemporary audiences. The project also gives insightful guidance by means of summaries and interconnections in terms of influences, provocations, and consonances, thereby reducing the time and cost of exploration of ideas. The historical texts are also supplemented by systematic thematic summaries and audiovisual resources covering a wide range of themes for the benefit of researchers, teachers, and students.
