## Thematic Overview ##
A thematic overview of SDA, from various perspectives, offers an accessible introduction to the key terms, debates, and interconnections of ideas. The overview offers definitions of four main types of SDA – grace, inspiration, miracles, and providence – as well as introductions to some of the most influential underlying narratives of SDA. The overview also explores the issue of encounter and assessment of SDA from first-, second-, and third-person perspectives, as well as the status and meaning of SDA within key worldviews. These worldviews include diverse philosophies of the world, philosophies of God, major theological and religious perspectives, and key historical developments.

## Curated Digital Library ##
A large, well-organised digital collection of primary source texts offers outstanding opportunities for in-depth reading and new scholarship from theological, philosophical, scientific and historical perspectives. This core of the collection consists of approximately two thousand historical texts by more than a thousand distinct authors. Besides the actual materials themselves, made available through a digital reader, the project has provided short biographical descriptions and summaries of the key works to facilitate engagement. In addition, the database records provocations, influences, and possible pattern-matches between works. Digital tools enable a reader to start with one work and gradually explore an entire network of interconnected ideas, often generating new insights and new avenues for reading and research.

## Audiovisual Library ##
The project provides a wide variety of audiovisual resources to suit a wide variety of interests and needs. Five cartoon animations of around one-minute each offer introductions suitable especially for schools on SDA, grace, inspiration, miracles, and providence. Five videos of around three-minutes offer mixed animation and live-footage covering the same themes at greater depth and detail. Around fifty project videos filmed during events of the project offer a variety of presentations and interviews of varying length that enable engagement with leading contemporary scholarship.

## Educational Materials ##
Teachers and students can benefit from materials developed for two live, online summer courses for university credit, run by Prof. Timothy McGrew in 2015 and 2016, making use of the materials of the digital library. The audio recordings with slides, together with additional course materials, have been collated and made available.

## Other Project-Specific Outputs ##
Over the period of development of these resources, 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016, the project organised a wide range of additional and related research and outreach activities. These activities included academic conferences at Oxford (2014), MIT (2015), and prior to the American Academy of Religion Conference (2016). Around 60 publications were generated over the course of the project, an early selection of which were compiled into a special edition of the European Journal for Philosophy of Religion, published in December 2015. Members of the project team also gave over a hundred talks to a range of universities, colleges, schools, and other venues, as well as interviews and articles in the media.

The project also facilitated the engagement of many other individuals, groups and institutions with the topic of special divine action. The project organised grant competitions for cluster groups, awarded to Mariano Asla and Omar Pivetta at Universidad Austral, Argentina; Ryan Byerly and Ryan Mullins at the University of Sheffied; and Dan O’Brien and William Gibson at Oxford Brookes University. Course development awards were made to Robert Larmer at the University of New Brunswick, Miguel de Asua at Colegio Maximo, Argentina, and Craig Boyd, St Louis University.

Members of the team also initiated their own projects that will, it is anticipated, develop ongoing research and resources. Benedikt Göcke at Oxford was awarded a 5-year €1,7 million grant from the German Research Foundation (DFG) for his proposal “A scientific theology?” based at Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany, starting summer 2016. Andrea Sangiacomo, who contributed to the conference in Oxford in 2014 and special edition of the European Journal for Philosophy of Religion, won a €250k grant award from the NWO (the Dutch Scientific Research Foundation), "Occasionalism and the secularization of early modern science: Understanding the dismissal of divine action during the scientific revolution.”
