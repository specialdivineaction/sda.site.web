title: Why 'Special' Divine Action

The word ‘special’ in the phrase ‘special divine action’ (SDA) distinguishes the subject matter of this project from a more general sense of divine action, namely the operation of a first or uncaused cause. SDA is usually considered as particular to time and place, as in the case of the inscription in Nazareth that states that the Word became flesh here. Such action is also generally considered to take place in response to some state of affairs in the world and often understood in terms of an intervention in the ordinary course of nature.

Although the demarcation of SDA from divine action in general is ancient, the distinction became especially important during the ‘deist controversy’ (c. 1700 – 1760) noted previously, when some persons (‘deists’) accepted the existence of a deity but denied divine action beyond that of creation. The idea of a cosmos  closed to divine action remains extremely influential across a spectrum of views generally labelled as naturalism or physicalism. In this context, questions about SDA often focus on the possibility or impossibility of extraordinary events that surpass the productive power of nature and are termed ‘miracles’. Nevertheless, within theology, religious studies, various traditions and religious experience, it is common practice to take account of distinct modes of SDA, especially grace, inspiration, miracles, and providence.
