**Why is the study of SDA important for me?**
*Because of what you are, where you are, and when you are*

Letâ€™s imagine a world, one that may or may not be the world in which we live, in which there is absolutely no special divine action. There are no miracles, there is no inspiration, no providential action, and no grace to transform and elevate human nature. Each being, thought and action is only the effect of some combination of other beings, thoughts and actions, all of which are within the scope of the natural order. To the best of our knowledge, this natural order is slowly decaying, even if there are temporary and isolated pockets of light, life and growth. Given our situation as tending to dissatisfaction, being doomed to die, and in a physical cosmos that is also gradually dying, would there be any hope for us if this is our world?

Imagine now a situation, one that corresponds to the actual world in which we live, in which there are widespread beliefs in narratives of divine intervention into the natural order. These narratives offer messages of hope, even in the face of personal and cosmic death, and are ably defended by some persons of great intellectual ability. Other persons, also of great intellectual ability, deny that such interventions have happened, or deny that they are possible, or deny that we could know about them. Like passengers on a doomed ocean liner arguing about whether there is a rescue ship on the horizon, there are few people who are aware of their situation who would simply be uninterested in this debate.

For all those who conclude, at least out of a sense of enlightened self-interest, that these arguments about SDA are worthy of study, then the special divine action project will, it is hoped, benefit them by making this study easy.
