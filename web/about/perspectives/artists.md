**Why is the study of SDA important for me?**
*What do you think art is for in the absence of SDA?*

Aristotle claimed that the aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance. So a world in which it is claimed that there is no inward significance to anything would be unlikely to have art, or at least much interesting art. Belief in SDA may not be the only way of discerning or attributing significance to the world, but it is surely one of the most powerful ways. Hence there is a prima facie supposition that SDA is important for artists.

There is much more specific connection in the actual history of art, which has been interwoven with liturgy and religion from the times of the earliest archaeological findings. Some varieties of monotheism have been cautious or hostile toward representational art, because what is represented has often turned into an idol. Although some Christians have had similar attitudes, the Second Council of Nicaea (787) strongly encouraged the visual arts because of the belief expressed in a formal way by the First Council of Nicaea (325): Jesus Christ is of one being with God. Hence God has become visible, and “that greater than which nothing can be conceived” can be represented in art. The explosion of creativity in the visual arts for at least the next thousand years owes its source principally to this understanding of special divine action.

Most artists today have abandoned interest in the concretely given supernatural or even its felt absence as a theme. Whether art has flourished as a result is questionable. What is striking is that idiosyncratic initiatives that have once again taken up such themes have often produced some of the most innovative art of the contemporary age, such as the Sagrada Familía of Barcelona. Whether or not one shares the actual beliefs of these artists, it is at least interesting to explore what motivates them. The special divine action project provides resources to assist this exploration.
