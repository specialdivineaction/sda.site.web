**Why is the study of SDA important for me?**
*You want to know how others think and to develop your own ideas for humane flourishing*

Atheists might, it seems, have little concern with special divine action beyond the need to deny that it exists. Even this limited aim, however, is one that is likely to benefit from opportunities to test and refine arguments. The special divine action provides such opportunities by facilitating access to a broad landscape of persons, ideas, and debates.

Beyond this limited aim there are more subtle reasons for the importance of this topic. Even if one decides that there is no special divine action, the fact of widespread belief in such action is as certain as anything can be. Contrary to the way in which arguments on miracles are often framed, such beliefs are not usually about isolated interventions into the natural order. Instead there is a narrative context that shapes the interpretation of the world and ultimately the cultures and societies that form the human world. Hence it is important to understand this context for all kinds of reasons.

There is also the disquiet of the human ‘soul’ (if such a term may be permitted, at least poetically). As the Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa writes in The Book of Disquiet, “Where is God, even if he doesn't exist? I want to pray and to weep, to repent of crimes I didn't commit, to enjoy the feeling of forgiveness like a caress that's more than maternal.” The quest for a truly humane atheism is one that is likely to benefit from the thoughtful examination of theological writings to understand better the contours of human being and yearning. Such a study is unlikely to be satisfied with a reductive or mechanistic deism. Hence for this reason also the study of special divine action is important for atheists.
