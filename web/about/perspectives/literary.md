**Why is the study of SDA important for me?**
*You see the ‘writing on the wall’ and want instead to go from ‘strength to strength’.*

Can we understand great literature or even seriously study many languages such as English, French, Spanish, Italian, or Russian, among others, without that great book-begetting book of special divine action, the Bible? In a parallel fashion, Modern Standard Arabic is derived ultimately from Quranic Arabic. Many languages, such as that of the Turkana people of Kenya, have gained written form due to missionary work, itself motivated ultimately by considerations of special divine action.

In the case of English, Shakespeare’s works and the King James Bible developed together, shaping the style, language, material, and dramatic narratives of most subsequent great literary works beyond the commonplace. As St Jerome observed, “Ignorance of Scripture is ignorance of Christ,” but today it is clear that ignorance of Scripture is also ignorance of English, along with a host of other languages. A loss of Scriptural sensitivity among students and even many scholars is gradually rendering a great deal of literature opaque, and it is unclear what deist or atheist narratives can or ever could offer comparable inspiration to the rich dramas, visions, parables, genealogies, miracle stories, and speeches of Scripture.

Hence for those literary scholars who see the “writing on the wall” and “signs of the times,” and who want instead to go from “strength to strength” (to quote the King James Bible), the study of special divine action is prudent and potentially fruitful.
