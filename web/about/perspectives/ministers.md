**Why is the study of SDA important for me?**
*You want your ministry to be fruitful*

The vaguely-defined term ‘religion’ (like the vaguely-defined term ‘science’) covers a vast range of beliefs and practices. Yet the majority of practitioners of religion have some kind of belief in SDA. Those who are indifferent or hostile to belief in SDA, or even to the existence of God, usually remain interested in the questions surrounding such beliefs.

Yet in some parts of the world ministers do surprisingly little study of SDA in their training, but are limited to studying its purported effects, notably Scripture. Even this teaching is sometimes shaped by deist or atheist attitudes elsewhere, filtering out much consideration of the possibility and interpretation of SDA. This filtering shapes attitudes to miracles, but also means that ministers often have a poor understanding of how grace, inspiration and providence might work in societies and individual lives. As a result, ministers often remain disconnected in their academic formation from their own texts, practices, history, and traditions, as well as the beliefs that shaped those traditions and made them fruitful.

The special divine action project offers many opportunities to redress this balance. In particular it offers the chance to explore many ways in which scholars of the past have engaged intellectually with the topic of SDA without inevitably explaining it away. This exploration also offers a rich diversity of metaphors by which one or more aspects of SDA can be understood, debated and explained to others in straightforward terms for the benefit of ministry.
