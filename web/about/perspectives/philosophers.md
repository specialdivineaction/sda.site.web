**Why is the study of SDA important for me?**
*You gain a new world of ideas to explore*

Although philosophers deal principally with first causes and principles of the natural world using natural reason, there is a long and fruitful history of engagement of philosophers with ideas about special divine action. Theology has made use of philosophical ideas such as ‘word/ordering principle’ (λόγος) or ‘substance’ (οὐσία) in descriptions of the effects of special divine action. Conversely, new ideas or emphases, such ‘the will’, ‘the person’ and ‘I-thou relatedness’ have emerged or gained prominence in debates about special divine action and become major topics of philosophical study.

At the present time, however, philosophical engagement with the topic of special divine action is often limited to a miniscule number of topics and writers – often just David Hume abstracted from all the debates before his time or the contributions and responses of contemporaries. This focus has had a constricting effect insofar as other perspectives are ignored. More subtly, the field has become dominated by questions about isolated interventions regarding non-personal aspects of the world, filtering out the purported effects of inspiration, grace, and particular providence on persons.

The special divine action project drastically reduces the time and effort required to explore a much wider range of thinkers working in a similar context to Hume, often with different arguments and conclusions. The project will also, it is hoped, serve as a reminder that questions of special divine action involve theological contexts and narratives that go beyond isolated divine interventions, contexts that involve many philosophical ideas and debates. Even treated simply as a playground of ideas or thought experiments, history suggests that their study will stimulate new insights.
