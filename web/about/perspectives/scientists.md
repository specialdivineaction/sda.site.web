**Why is the study of SDA important for me?**
*You can benefit from examining sources of scientific understanding, motivation, and ethics*

The work of science might seem limited to what is not special divine action. The careful observations, measurements, and experimental methods associated with science in the modern sense can be used to examine extraordinary objects or conditions, such as the Shroud of Turin or unlikely medical cures. Such studies may lead to hypotheses of natural causes or to the conclusion that the cause is simply unknown. In the latter case, a judgment might be made that a miracle has taken place. Yet the work of science throughout the process is simply to study what is natural by natural means.

Nevertheless, there are deeper and more complex influences between scientific and religious beliefs and practices. It may be no accident that the development of experimental methods in the thirteenth century to isolate causes coincided with the development of the philosophy of natures and of miracles, as if the consideration of the supernatural helped to bring what is natural into focus. Beliefs favouring certain kinds of SDA have also helped shape many of the grand narratives that form scientifically-valuable attitudes to the world today, such as intelligible and law-like order, temporal progression and transcendent truth. Indeed, those people whose culture has been shaped for the longest period by belief in a covenant with God involving grace, inspiration, miracles, and providence, have also been astoundingly fruitful in science.

These facts suggest that at least there is no simplistic conflict between scientifically-formed minds and belief in special divine action. At a deeper level, they also hint at subtle connections between cultures shaped by certain kinds of beliefs in SDA and fruitfulness in scientific insights. The special divine action project, which provides many and varied examples thinkers exploring SDA in the light of modern science, offers opportunities to explore these connections.
