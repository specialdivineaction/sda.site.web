**Why is the study of SDA important for me?**
*You want inspiration and success, helped by materials that are easy to use*

Any well-rounded education ought to an exploration of the views and questions about special divine action. Such study facilitates better understanding of what motivates many people in the world, encourages engagement with the big questions of life, and raises awareness of the impact of faith in such action on other fields. To give one of many examples, musical notation evolved in order to sing liturgically to God, in response to the purported special divine action of God’s self-revelation.

Special divine action is a core topic in religious matters, of course, and specific courses in philosophy, theology, religious studies and psychology may benefit from the materials of the project. Some countries with histories influenced by deism place restrictions on teaching religion in public schools, which might raise questions over the use of such materials. But the study of views and debates regarding special divine action is not ‘teaching religion’. On the contrary, the special divine action project facilitates objective study by giving access to primary sources along with thematic written and audiovisual summaries of diverse views. This diversity is much broader, in fact, than the narrow range of texts and authors cited in many teaching materials today that purport to introduce the topic objectively.

The study of special divine action also has an impressive academic track record. The professor (now chair) of philosophy who started the collection of sources that led to this project has described this work as “the most important personal research of my academic life.” Students at various project activities have also kindly provided over two hundred statements of appreciation. To the best of our assessment to date, the materials of this project therefore inspire and encourage success.
