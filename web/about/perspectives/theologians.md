**Why is the study of SDA important for me?**
*You can’t live without it!*

Special divine action is the lifeblood of theology and its very reason for existence. Theology exists either because special divine action is real and its effects need to be understood, or because it is at least believed to be real by large numbers of people, and what they understand need to be understood – as far as possible from their perspective.

At the present time, it is not uncommon for the ‘no miracles’ dictum of physicalism to seep even into the attitudes of theologians to special divine action. These attitudes are compounded sometimes by a loss of the ability to grasp what a faith perspective is like and the assumption that religious motivations can be reduced to non-religious ones. Faced with the inability of theology to engage with its own subject matter, it then becomes dry, distorted or dies off entirely.

The special divine action project will therefore, it is hoped, be of great value in revitalising theology. The project facilitates engagement with thinkers who have previously debated deism or atheism, from a variety of worldviews, and will also help to remind people of what the rich varieties of special divine action look like from a perspective of faith.
