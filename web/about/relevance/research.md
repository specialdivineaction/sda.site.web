*Could you identify a few directions for research and study?*

One of the best ways of starting can be to start with play. Take a look at the historical influence map and pick out some source that you have not seen or heard of, and start to read and explore connections.

As more concrete examples, the database can be used to identify key figures who provoked discussions (Benedict Spinoza and David Hume and David Friedrich Strauss, for example, but also John Toland and William Fleetwood and Tindal), surveyed entire controversies (like the Deist Controversy or the Colenso Controversy or the reactions to Essays and Reviews), or wrote pivotal works that became points of reference for almost all later work on the subject (Joseph Butler, David Hume, George Campbell, John Leland, David Friedrich Strauss, Abraham Kuenen).

The database can also be used to study the history of the impact of a particular work. Hume’s essay “Of Miracles” provides an interesting case study, but the exercise is equally significant when applied to works like Butler’s Analogy of Religion, which turns out to have been a good deal more influential in Butler’s own time than earlier thinkers like A. C. McGiffert thought.

There are also forgotten avenues of argument to explore. Charles Leslie’s “Four Rules,” for example, continued to be influential well into the 19th century, and John James Blunt’s “undesigned coincidences” has just resurfaced in the 21st century as a valuable contribution to contemporary discussions of the reliability of the Christian scriptures. Several commentators have noted that Thomas Paine’s Age of Reason, Part II constitutes one of the early skeptical forays into New Testament criticism, but he was preceded in some of his arguments by Peter Annett. Edward Herbert’s arguments for deism as opposed to any revealed religion may be profitably compared with those of Toland and Tindal. Stanley Leathes gives a distinctive twist to the Christian appeal to prophecy. And even in the more traditional works on the subject, such as those by John Davison or Edward Chandler, there is much interesting material and (particularly in Davison) some fascinating methodological observations.

*How would you recommend exploring this collection to find a research question that is interesting?*

One way to start would be to pick a work that interests you –  chapter 15 of Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, for example – and start exploring, tracing its influence and looking at responses from people like Richard Watson, David Dalrymple, and others. Exploring the literature in this way will uncover recurring lines of argument, indebtedness (sometimes acknowledged, sometimes not) of some authors to others, and sometimes an unexpected line of approach to a standard position.

Another idea would be to search the database topically in order to map the tides of interest and opinion on a subject like messianic prophecy or the resurrection of Jesus. Geography may be as important as chronology, and sometimes this line of approach reveals fascinating fault lines in positions that are often presented as monolithic. New England Unitarianism in the early 19th century, for example, is by no means fully represented by Emerson and his school. Any account that leaves out Andrews Norton’s contributions to the discussion of miracles and the genuineness of the Gospels will be seriously imbalanced.

A third approach would be to trace one writer’s influence on colleagues and on students in subsequent generations. Andrews Norton is interesting in this regard, particularly in his influence on John Gorham Palfrey and Andrew Preston Peabody; but he also reached out to orthodox writers like Richard Whately and Charles Hodge. Thomas Chalmers influenced a generation of students, including Charles Murray Nairne. Thomas Secker, who became Archbishop of Canterbury, was a schoolmate of Joseph Butler. Butler himself, while a student, corresponded with Samuel Clarke. Philip Doddridge was an intimate friend of both Isaac Watts and Nathaniel Lardner. There are many other examples in the database.

*How do I start my career (as a graduate student)?*

Graduate students need to identify a few areas that interest them and can serve as a source of inspiration for early-career publications. The resources in this database can serve as the basis for conference papers, journal publications and thesis and dissertation topics. In addition, many of these older works illuminate contemporary controversies and can profitably be brought to bear on discussions and arguments in the current literature. And the fact that these sources are not at present widely discussed means that there is a rich ground here for research and publication that is genuinely original.

*As early-career Faculty, how can these resources help me to branch out?*

Pedagogy – Standard courses in the history of philosophy or the philosophy of religion would be greatly enriched by the inclusion of materials archived here. The graphic depiction of relationships in this database should facilitate both the identification of relevant resources and the mapping of debates that are too often represented by only a single author, as if (say) Hume’s essay “Of Miracles” simultaneously inaugurated and ended the discussion.

Publication – Journal article acceptance rates in the humanities are generally quite low, partly because so many topics have been so saturated with contemporary scholarship that the price of entry, in terms of hours spent combing the current literature, is incredibly high. But many of the works in this database have received little or no attention for the past century. In particular, scholars at all stages of their careers should find the set of “possible pattern matches” to be a useful guide to connections from work to work that are intrinsically promising and as yet unexplored. This is a field ripe for harvest and light on labourers.

*As established Faculty, how can these resources benefit me?*

Pedagogy – Established faculty often have the privilege of guiding advanced students toward thesis and dissertation topics. The resources in this database afford a wealth of relatively unexplored topics as well as forgotten resources that are relevant to current topics of debate. Such resources go beyond the more obvious issues of miracles and prophecy. Contemporary discussions of divine hiddenness, for example, would be enriched by an exploration of the contributions of Joseph Butler (in The Analogy of Religion), John Howe (in The Living Temple), and Henry Rogers (in The Eclipse of Faith).

Research – Scholars who have reached the middle of their careers will already have plenty of ideas of what they would like to pursue. But whether they are searching for material to enrich an existing project or for themes large enough to deserve book-length exploration, this database will not only provide the raw materials but also indicate sets of previously unexplored interconnections that can help make such a project a worthy undertaking. Anyone working in the history of modern philosophy, 19th century philosophy, the philosophy of religion, or the history of theology should find this resource invaluable.
