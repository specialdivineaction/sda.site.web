Problems about special divine action trouble our understanding of prayer. Even if God hears our prayers, what can he do about them? Many prayers are for rectification of the past - 'Let it not be that she has drowned', e.g. the fervent prayers of the relatives of those on the Malaysian airliner come to mind. There seems to be a distinction between prayers relating to actions and resolutions of one's own, in which one calls for a strengthening of one's own will, and prayers addressed solely to the will of God. I explore the phenomenology of prayer, with a view to understanding just what 'the will of God' might mean in this context.
