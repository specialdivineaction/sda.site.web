In a mechanistic world, such as dominated the modern period due in large measure to the resounding success of Newtonian science, all natural events were understood to occur deterministically from lock-step, natural causes. If God were to act, beyond creating and sustaining the universe, in special ways to alter the course of nature, God’s action would be considered ‘miraculous’ (in the Humean sense, at least): an objective intrusion into or suspension of the flow of natural processes and a violation of the laws of nature as discovered by science. Beginning in the twentieth century, however, philosophical arguments have been made that the natural sciences now can be interpreted in ways that allow for objective divine action that is non-interventionist (i.e., non-miraculous). In this lecture I will explore a variety of approaches to NIODA, assessing their relative fruitfulness and considering the challenges to them. I will argue that quantum mechanics, and thus ‘bottom-up causality,’ provides the most promising such approach.
