The subject of special divine action, once a vigorous field of academic discussion and debate, fell into comparative neglect in the 20th century as Hume’s famous essay became, in many places, the only piece anyone was required to read on the subject.

Recent work, however, has shaken this consensus severely and brought Hume’s reasoning under heavy fire, providing a welcome opportunity to reopen the subject. For this purpose, it is important to revisit the long history of the discussion, a history that not only anticipates many modern moves but also includes perspectives that can, properly appreciated, advance the state of the art.
