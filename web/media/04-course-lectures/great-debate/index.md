This course is a survey of the discussion and debate over special divine action from the work of the French philosophes and Thomas Paine in the late 18th century through the popularization of the TÃ¼bingen school's sceptical views in the late 19th century and responses to them by authors like Lightfoot and Westcott. We make a special study of debates about miracles and prophecy and the methodological considerations that both sides invoked in these discussions.
